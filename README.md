# **README: Predicting Heart Attack Likelihood in Gen Z**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to **predict heart attack likelihood** among young individuals (Gen Z) using **machine learning models**. It analyzes the impact of lifestyle factors such as **sleep habits, screen time, stress levels, diet, physical activity, and BMI** on heart health. The goal is to identify high-risk individuals and promote **preventive healthcare measures**.

## **Dataset Information**
- **Dataset Name:** Heart Attack Youngsters India
- **Total Records:** 10,000
- **Key Features:**
  - Sleep Duration (hrs/day)
  - Screen Time (hrs/day)
  - Diet Type
  - Stress Level
  - Physical Activity Level
  - BMI (kg/mÂ²)
- **Target Variable:** Heart Attack Likelihood (Yes/No)


## **Machine Learning Models Used**
Three classification models were tested:
1. **Random Forest (Best Performing Model - 79.6% Accuracy)**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) - 79.6% Accuracy**
3. **XGBoost - 78.4% Accuracy**


## **Results & Findings**
- **Stress levels, BMI, and screen time were the most significant predictors of heart disease risk.**
- **People with high stress and poor sleep had an increased likelihood of heart attacks.**
- **The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (79.6%) and was the best performer.**
- **Reducing stress, improving sleep habits, and limiting screen time can lower heart disease risk.**

## **Future Improvements**
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse age groups and demographics.
- Integrating real-time health tracking using wearable devices.
- Improving accuracy using deep learning techniques.
